# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether or not there was evidence of academic dishonesty amongst 9th graders at Thomas High School. This was accomplished by removing their scores from the data set, rerunning the analysis, and then comparing to the results. A large discrepancy would indicate some sort of fraud. 
  
## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

The district summaries are nearly identical before and after removing scores from 9th graders at Thomas High School. This implies the district summwary was not affected.

- How is the school summary affected?

There was a negligible differences in the scores from Thomas High School's summary. 

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School was the second highest performing school before and after replacing the scores. Removing them did not affect the school's performance relative to other schools.
