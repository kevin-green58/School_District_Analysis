# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether or not there was evidence of academic dishonesty amongst 9th graders at Thomas High School. This was accomplished by removing their scores from the data set, rerunning the analysis, and then comparing to the results. A large discrepancy would indicate some sort of fraud.
